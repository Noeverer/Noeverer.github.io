# 1144.Decrease Elements To Make Array Zigzag

Given an array nums of integers, a move consists of choosing any element and decreasing it by 1.

An array A is a zigzag array if either:

- Every even-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie. A[0] > A[1] < A[2] > A[3] < A[4] > ...
- OR, every odd-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie. A[0] < A[1] > A[2] < A[3] > A[4] < ...

Return the minimum number of moves to transform the given array nums into a zigzag array.

Example 1:

Example 2:

# APPROACH ONE

## 自己分析

from your python code , i learn that

- the comparison among adjacent element and the pivot in elements
- how to count even and odd in a array respectively
